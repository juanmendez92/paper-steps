## [Unreleased][unreleased]

 - Added methods to disable and re-enable `continue` button during after form submit.
 - Added `this.debounce` to `paper-button` click methods to avoid multiple submit events.

   - `paper-steps` will advance to the next step upon successful HTTP response (status code 200).
